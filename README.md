# Banking System
This is a simple banking system made with Python. 

To use, simply run **BankingSystem.py**. It allows you to either create a new account/card or login. First create the account, then use the card number and PIN to login. 
Once you have logged in, you can do many things such as check your balance, add income to your balance, and transfer money to other accounts. 

The file **database.py** holds all of the sqlite3 database functions. I plan on next adding some sort of GUI or possibly making a simple website with FLASK.
